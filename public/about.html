<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Ramisa. I am 29 years old, happily married and currently employed as a doctor in the NHS. 
  I have been a doctor for 4 years now and am in my second year of training in radiology.</p>

<p>Despite having been in medicine for so long, I have known for a while that my heart is elsewhere. 
  After a lot of soul-searching I have found coding and feel that I am only just stepping onto the path I am supposed to be on in life. Over the last few weeks I have been learning how to code online and am soon to take a bootcamp in front-end web development. 
  This portoflio is the result of my studies and efforts. I hope that I can use this to track my progress and document my journey. 
  I also hope that it can serve to inspire others who haven't yet found their true calling.</p>

<p>I have fallen in love with coding and hope that this reflects in my work. For those who are pondering on making a start, take a leap of faith if you dare. 
  I promise you won't be disappointed. Happy browsing! </p>
